# Fruits & Vegetables Classification

A production-ready Python project that trains, evaluates, and serves a CNN classifier to distinguish fruits vs vegetables from images.

This repo demonstrates:
✅ dataset preprocessing & augmentation  
✅ modular PyTorch model training  
✅ performance evaluation with metrics & confusion matrix  
✅ tests and reproducibility  
✅ containerized inference
